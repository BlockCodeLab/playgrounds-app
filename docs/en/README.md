## What it is

This is a brand-new, powerful, and open blocks programming platform inspired by MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) application and 
Microsoft's [MakeCode](https://microsoft.com/makecode) project. Built on the same underlying technology (Scratch-Blocks/Google Blockly), 
the platform features a completely redeveloped upper-layer application architecture with all components asynchronously loaded on demand. 
It offers enhanced capabilities for hardware integration and programming support, providing multiple programming modes: real-time, script-based, and downloadable, 
to meet the technical requirements of various application scenarios and projects.

The platform integrates a variety of graphical programming tools and application utilities, delivering a one-stop solution for 
development and education. Users can fulfill all their maker project needs without leaving the platform, significantly improving 
efficiency and convenience while offering an enjoyable experience for makers and educators alike.
